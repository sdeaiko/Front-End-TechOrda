                Saitama, also known by his hero name Caped Baldy, is the titular protagonist of the webcomic/manga/anime series One Punch-Man, and the most powerful known being in the series. Having apparently trained himself so hard that he unintentionally broke the natural limiter that prevents living beings from going beyond superhuman condition, Saitama faces an existential crisis as he is now too powerful to gain any thrill from his heroics.

            <p style="padding-bottom: 40px;">
                This system does hit many major movement patterns. You have a pushing motion (push-ups), core training (set-up), leg training (squat), and some cardio (running). As far as fitness routines gees, this is superior to what people normally do at the gym. That is, these bodyweight exercises hit more muscle groups in a more natural pattern. No cable carls, no strange forced machine movements, and much less injury risk since all exercises are bodyweight only.

                The idea is, you want to stick to sets of 5 to 7 in the early stages. Increase your reps by 1 per set until you hit a plateau (meaning, your progress stalls). Then add more sets with less reps. So if you <strong>can't</strong> hit 5×10 (5 sets of 10 reps, 50 reps total), next day, try 7×7 (7 sets of 7 reps, 49 reps total). This way, your reps is about the same, but you have them drawn out over a longer period of time, giving you time to recover.
            </p>

            <p class="sample-starter">
                But if you <strong>can</strong> hit 5×10, then you’d try 5×11 next workout. Make sense? <strong>Always use 5-sets as your benchmark!</strong> And whenever you feel like it, you can replace a workout day with a “test day”. Meaning, you try your hardest to make it to 100 of each exercise.

                    Pushups are an exercise in which a person, keeping a prone position, with the hands palms down under the shoulders, the balls of the feet on the ground, and the back straight, pushes the body up and lets it down by an alternate straightening and bending of the arms.
                    <br>Push-up variations:
                   <ul class="push-up">
                    <li>Knee push-ups</li>
                    <li>Wall push-ups</li>
                    <li>Incline push-up</li>
                    <li>Decline-push up</li>
                    <li>One-arm push-up</li>
                    <li>Weighted push-up</li>
                   </ul> 
                </dd>
            
                <dt>Sit-ups:</dt>
                <dd>
                    Introducing sit ups to your workouts is one way to help boost your core strength. It can also help improve your digestion, as the motion strengthens the abdominal muscles that allow the intestines to function correctly. This ab exercise can be performed with using nothing more than your own bodyweight which means you can do it anywhere, whether that in or out the gym.  
                    <br><br>
                    One of the many reasons sit ups are ever-popular is that they're easy to modify (e.g. doing them on an incline or while holding weights) so you can continue to challenge yourself as your core strength improves.

                <dt>Squats:</dt>
                <dd>
                    Squats burn calories and might help you lose weight. They also lower your chances of injuring your knees and ankles. As you exercise, the movement strengthens your tendons, bones, and ligaments around the leg muscles.
